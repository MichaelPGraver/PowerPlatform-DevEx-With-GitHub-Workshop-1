## Scanning capabilities

### [Code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning)

> [!NOTE]
> Not available in the repository while its visibility is private. I will need to wait the last days to finalize this section.
> I will try first to let GitHub try to setup the code scanning related to the code under `resources/` for me.
> If it doesn't work, I will try to do it manually.

### [Secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning#about-secret-scanning)

> [!NOTE]
> Not available in the repository while its visibility is private. I will need to wait the last days to finalize this section.
> I will try to test and document a demonstration scenario in a different repository to show how it works during the workshop.

## Dependencies management

### [Dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)

// Screenshot to add here

In your repository created from this GitHub repository template in the [chapter 3](./03-InitializeWorkspace.md) of this workshop, follow the steps below to access the Dependency graph:
1. Go to the `Insights` tab of your repository
2. Click on the `Dependency graph` menu
3. You should see the list of dependencies used in your repository

### [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide)

- [Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts#github-dependabot-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)
- [Dependabot security updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates)
- [Dependabot version updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)
