## What will we try to achieve together? ü§î

In this workshop, we will explore how GitHub capabilities such as Codespaces, Copilot, and Advanced Security can enhance the experience of Power Platform developers.

By immersing ourselves in hands-on exercises and practical examples, we will discover how these tools can streamline development workflows, boost productivity, and enhance the overall development experience.

Join us on this journey as we unlock the full potential of GitHub for Power Platform development.

## But first, let start with an icebreaker activity üòÅ

In this GitHub template repository - _which will be the starting point of your journey_ - I invite you to:

1. go to the [**Just say hi**](https://github.com/rpothin/PowerPlatform-DevEx-With-GitHub-Workshop/discussions/categories/just-say-hi) discussion category
2. create a new discussion to quickly introduce yourself
3. react to other discussions from fellow participants to share a smile üòä
